# SongBot

## Installation

To compile, use `./gradlew shadowJar`. You should then find `SongBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in `build/libs`.

Alternatively, you can run it without compiling with `./gradlew run`.

On the first startup, a `config.properties` file will be created and the bot will automatically shut down.

Change the `config.properties` file and start the bot up again.
